\arguments{
\item{age}{Age in years}

\item{gender}{Gender can be either "M" for male or "F" for female}

\item{source}{Source of the equations. Either from Bosgra et al. "bosgra" or from ScitoVation publications as "sciv"}

\item{qc_var}{variability for cardiac output. Used to account for exercise level. Can only be used when source = "sciv"}
}
